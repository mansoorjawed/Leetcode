This repository is to track LeetCode practice. It is a collection of all attempted problem and the approach/steps taken in figuring it out (usually in markdown files). It is supposed to act as a knowledge base. It (should) include better documentations for the current solution as it should include steps taken in figuring out the solution or explaining the code. The plan is to improve runtime later and/or coming up with a different solution entirely. This also helps in keeping track of topics and related information. Occasionally, it may include additional implementation due to not all functions being provided by LeetCode e.g. Judge.
